// backend is then absent and the sync specs fail in ways that look like flakes.

  // app's own sync may still be in flight, and loses that race maybe one run
  // in three. It passes serially every time and the product behaviour is
  // sound. A retry does not hide a real break (that fails both attempts); it
  // stops a known race from blocking a release. The race itself is worth
